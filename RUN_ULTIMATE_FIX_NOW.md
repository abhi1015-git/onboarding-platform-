# ✅ ULTIMATE_FIX.sql - READY TO RUN!

## 🔧 What Was Fixed:

The script had a conflict with existing assets in your database. I've updated it to:

1. ✅ **Update existing assets** - Adds missing `type` column to existing assets
2. ✅ **Delete sample assets** - Removes any conflicting sample data
3. ✅ **Insert fresh assets** - Adds new sample assets without conflicts

## 🚀 Run This Now:

1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor**
2. **Copy ALL content from `ULTIMATE_FIX.sql`**
3. **Paste and click "Run"**
4. **Should complete successfully!**

## ✅ What It Will Do:

### Database Structure:
- ✅ Recreates `it_requests` table with proper foreign keys
- ✅ Adds ALL missing columns to `candidates`
- ✅ Fixes `profiles`, `assets`, `candidate_documents`
- ✅ Creates `operational_units` table

### Data Seeding:
- ✅ Creates 7 departments (Engineering, Design, Product, HR, Sales, Marketing, Finance)
- ✅ Creates 3 users (admin, hr, it)
- ✅ Updates candidate statuses
- ✅ Creates IT requests for all candidates
- ✅ Adds 7 sample assets

### Verification:
- ✅ Shows summary counts
- ✅ Lists departments
- ✅ Lists users
- ✅ Shows candidate breakdown
- ✅ Shows IT request breakdown

## 📊 Expected Output:

At the end, you should see:

```
SUMMARY:
- total_candidates: X
